# How do I change the color threshold for a column?

While we tend to auto-pick relatively good thresholds, sometimes you may want to change a threshold so that it looks better or is more biologically relevant.

To change the color threshold, click on the column menu at the top and choose 'Display'. From there click 'custom',  enter your new thresholds, and click 'Done'.
