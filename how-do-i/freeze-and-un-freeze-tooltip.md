# How do I copy information from the tooltip?

When you are in the Xena Visual Spreadsheet viewing mode, mouse over anywhere on sheet will trigger a tooltip to show up on the upper left corner. Sometimes you might want to copy the sample id in the tooltip, or click on the url link out. You need to first freeze the tooltip.

To **freeze** the tooltip, you need to "Alt-click", i.e. hold on the ALT key on your computer and at the same time click the left mouse button.

To **unfreeze** the tooltip, click on the close \(X\) icon.
