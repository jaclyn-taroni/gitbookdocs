# MuPIT

MuPIT is a separate project from the Karchin Lab at John Hopkins. We link to them to help users gain another perspective on the data they are seeing in Xena. From their Help Page:

> MuPIT interactive is an online tool that allows you to map sequence variants from their genomic position onto protein structures. Viewing a variant on protein structure can be useful in interpreting its potential biological consequences. After mapping, the variants are displayed on an interactive 3d structure. The user may turn variants on and off, and display annotations on the protein structure.
